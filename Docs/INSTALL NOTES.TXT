== Changes in this version ==

 * Changed "Recognize by folder/file" to "Link to removable drive" and removed the possibility for the user to input any path they want. This should greatly reduce the risk of misconfiguration.

 * Added additional check for fixed disk drives before synchronizing to warn user in case they have linked a device configuration to a local hard drive instead of their removable drive.

 * Several new synchronize patterns have been added. These are now available when editing your device configurations.

 * Synchronize patterns have been moved away from the device-config.xml file to simplify adding of new patterns in the future. PLEASE NOTE that any custom patterns in the existing device-config.xml file will be lost upon upgrade.

 * New "Report bug" menu item for easy reporting of bugs via the Notpod issue tracker on Github.

 * Album artist is now supported in several sync patterns.

 * Added support for %ARTISTINITIAL% macro in sync patterns.

 * Fixed icon in synchronize status window.

 * Fixed exception when iTunes library path was a network drive (Issue #12)
